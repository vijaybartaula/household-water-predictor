# Bathroom Tips
st.markdown("#### Bathroom")
st.markdown("""
- **Install a low-flow toilet**: High-efficiency toilets use 1.28 gallons per flush, compared to older models that use 3.5 to 7 gallons.
- **Install a low-flow showerhead**: Reduces water flow without sacrificing pressure.
- **Take shorter showers**: Reducing shower time by even a few minutes can save gallons of water.
- **Turn off water while brushing teeth**: This can save 3-5 gallons per minute.
""")

# Kitchen Tips
st.markdown("#### Kitchen")
st.markdown("""
- **Use a dishwasher only when full**: Dishwashers use less water than washing by hand if they are fully loaded.
- **Rinse fruits and vegetables in a bowl of water**: Instead of running the tap.
- **Use a water-saving faucet aerator**: Install aerators on kitchen faucets to reduce water flow without reducing performance.
- **Defrost food in the fridge or microwave**: Avoid running water over frozen food to defrost it.
""")

# Laundry Tips
st.markdown("#### Laundry")
st.markdown("""
- **Wash clothes in cold water**: This saves both water and energy.
- **Wash full loads**: Ensure the washing machine is full to maximize water use.
- **Use a high-efficiency washing machine**: These machines use significantly less water than traditional models.
""")

# Garden & Lawn Tips
st.markdown("#### Garden & Lawn")
st.markdown("""
- **Water plants early in the morning**: Watering in the morning minimizes evaporation.
- **Install a drip irrigation system**: Drip irrigation uses 30-50% less water than traditional sprinklers.
- **Use drought-resistant plants**: These plants require less water and are more resilient in dry conditions.
- **Mulch your garden**: Mulching helps retain soil moisture and reduces the need for frequent watering.
""")

# Home Maintenance Tips
st.markdown("#### Home Maintenance")
st.markdown("""
- **Fix leaks immediately**: A small drip from a leaking faucet can waste 20 gallons of water or more each day.
- **Install water-efficient appliances**: Consider washing machines, dishwashers, and refrigerators that are designed to use less water.
- **Insulate pipes**: Prevent water waste by ensuring water is at the right temperature immediately after turning on the faucet.

    st.warning("Households with more than 9 residents tend to have a significant impact on local water resources.")
    st.markdown("""
    With larger households, conserving water becomes even more crucial to ensure sustainable water use. Consider these impactful strategies:
    
    - **Efficient Water Use Planning**: Large households can implement a detailed plan to monitor and reduce water usage.
      - **Example**: Use a weekly checklist to track water use, and designate one person to oversee this effort.
    
    - **Greywater Recycling**: For larger households, consider a greywater recycling system to reuse water from baths, sinks, and washing machines.
      - **Example**: Install a system that collects greywater and reuses it for toilet flushing and irrigation.
    
    - **Water-Efficient Landscaping**: Consider xeriscaping your yard (landscaping that reduces or eliminates the need for irrigation).
      - **Example**: Replace grass lawns with native plants that require minimal water.
    
    - **Educate and Encourage Family Members**: Everyone in a large household must be aware of the importance of water conservation and be motivated to participate.
      - **Example**: Set up a monthly family challenge to reduce water usage and track progress together.

    - **Water-Saving Appliances for Larger Loads**: Choose appliances that are designed to handle large families but still conserve water, like high-efficiency dishwashers and washing machines.
      - **Example**: A family of 10 using a water-efficient dishwasher can save hundreds of liters each week compared to using a less efficient model.

    **Remember**: Every small change can add up to substantial water savings over time, especially in large households.
