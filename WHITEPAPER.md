# Household Water Usage Prediction: A Data-Driven Approach to Conservation

## Executive Summary

This whitepaper presents a comprehensive analysis of a data-driven approach to household water usage prediction and conservation. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression modeling, we have developed a solution that accurately estimates daily household water consumption based on the number of residents. This technology not only provides households with valuable insights into their water usage patterns but also offers tailored conservation strategies based on household size and consumption patterns.

The solution comprises both a computational backend for data analysis and prediction, as well as an intuitive user interface implemented via Streamlit for easy access by non-technical users. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between household size and water usage, with each additional resident contributing approximately 75 liters of daily water consumption on average. This model serves as a foundation for developing more sophisticated water management strategies at both household and municipal levels.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Water scarcity is becoming an increasingly critical global challenge, with the United Nations estimating that by 2030, global water demand will exceed supply by 40%. As populations grow and climate change affects water availability, there is an urgent need for solutions that promote water conservation and efficient resource management.

Household water consumption represents a significant portion of overall water usage in developed countries. Understanding and predicting this consumption is essential for developing effective conservation strategies and infrastructure planning.

### 1.2 Project Objectives

This project addresses the following key objectives:

1. Develop a mathematical model that accurately predicts household water usage based on the number of residents
2. Create an accessible tool that provides households with personalized water usage estimates
3. Offer tailored water conservation recommendations based on household size and consumption patterns
4. Raise awareness about water conservation and efficient resource management
5. Provide a foundation for more sophisticated water management solutions

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Generation and Collection

To develop an accurate predictive model, we needed a representative dataset of household water usage patterns. We employed two approaches to data acquisition:

1. **Sample Data**: A manually curated dataset consisting of typical household sizes and corresponding water usage measurements
2. **Synthetic Data Generation**: A programmatically generated dataset based on established water consumption patterns and statistical distributions

For the synthetic data generation, we implemented the following approach:

```python
def generate_water_data():
    np.random.seed(42)
    residents = np.random.randint(1, 15, 100)  # Random number of residents between 1 and 15
    # Default assumption: 75 liters per person per day with variability
    usage = residents * np.random.normal(75, 10, 100)  # 75 liters per person with noise (std dev of 10)
    usage = np.clip(usage, 30, 1000)  # Ensure realistic values (clip outliers)
    return pd.DataFrame({"Residents": residents, "WaterUsage_Liters": usage})
```

This approach assumes an average daily water consumption of 75 liters per person, with normal distribution variability to account for different usage patterns. This aligns with global averages, though actual consumption varies significantly by region and socioeconomic factors.

### 2.2 Linear Regression Modeling

We employed linear regression, a well-established statistical method, to model the relationship between household size and water usage. This approach was selected for its interpretability, computational efficiency, and effectiveness for this specific use case.

The linear regression model can be expressed as:

$$\text{Water Usage (liters)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Number of Residents}$$

Where:
- $\beta_0$ represents the intercept (baseline water usage)
- $\beta_1$ represents the coefficient (additional water usage per resident)

The model was implemented using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python:

```python
X = df[["Residents"]]
y = df["WaterUsage_Liters"]
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
```

### 2.3 User Interface Development

To make the predictive model accessible to end-users, we developed an intuitive interface using Streamlit, an open-source framework for building data applications. The interface allows users to:

1. Input the number of residents in their household
2. View estimated daily water usage
3. Access tailored water conservation recommendations
4. Explore the underlying data and prediction model
5. Visualize the relationship between household size and water consumption

## 3. Results and Analysis

### 3.1 Model Performance

The linear regression model demonstrated a strong correlation between household size and water usage. The model coefficients reveal that:

1. Each additional resident contributes approximately 75 liters to daily household water consumption
2. There is a baseline water usage (intercept) that exists regardless of household size

This aligns with water usage patterns observed in real-world studies, where certain water-consuming activities (like gardening or appliance usage) are relatively constant regardless of household size, while others scale with the number of residents.

### 3.2 Visualization and Interpretation

The relationship between household size and water usage is illustrated in the following scatter plot with regression line:

![Household Size vs. Daily Water Usage](images/plot.png)

The visualization shows that while there is a clear linear trend, there is also variability in water usage among households of the same size. This variability can be attributed to factors not captured in our current model, such as:

- Household appliance efficiency
- Behavioral factors and conservation habits
- Seasonal variations
- Geographic and climate differences
- Socioeconomic factors

## 4. Implementation and User Experience

### 4.1 User Interface Components

The Streamlit application provides users with a comprehensive water usage analysis and conservation toolset:

1. **Input Controls**: Simple slider interface for specifying household size
2. **Prediction Display**: Clear presentation of estimated daily water usage
3. **Conservation Recommendations**: Tailored suggestions based on household size and estimated usage
4. **Data Exploration**: Options to view the underlying data and mathematical model
5. **Visualization**: Interactive chart showing the relationship between household size and water usage

### 4.2 Conservation Recommendation System

A key feature of the application is its recommendation engine, which provides tailored water conservation advice based on:

1. **Household Size Categories**:
   - Single or two-person households (1-2 residents)
   - Small family households (3-4 residents)
   - Medium family households (5-6 residents)
   - Large family households (7-10 residents)
   - Very large households (11+ residents)

2. **Per-Person Usage Thresholds**:
   - If usage exceeds 75 liters per person per day, additional conservation measures are recommended

3. **Location-Specific Recommendations**:
   - Different suggestions for bathroom, kitchen, laundry, garden, and general home maintenance

For larger households (>9 residents), the system provides specialized strategies that address the unique challenges of managing water usage in such settings, including:
- Efficient water use planning
- Greywater recycling systems
- Water-efficient landscaping
- Family education and engagement
- High-capacity water-efficient appliances

By combining statistical modeling with intuitive user interfaces and tailored recommendation systems, we have created a solution that can drive meaningful changes in water consumption patterns at both individual and community levels.

As water scarcity continues to threaten communities worldwide, tools like this will become increasingly valuable for promoting responsible resource management. The modular and extensible nature of our approach allows for continuous improvement and adaptation to different contexts, making it a versatile foundation for future water conservation initiatives.
